Seems to be a mini poodle; was quite furry when we got him. He could be a mixed dog, as he is smaller than other poodles, roughly the size of a full-grown shih tzu. To ensure he grows back a healthy coat, we shaved him. Now, his coat is growing back. Unlike most poodle breeds, Marley doesn't get yippy often. He loves to go for long walks and is outdoor potty trained. We are unable to keep him as our apartment doesn't allow dogs and we travel often. He can do a variety of tricks and is smart; seems to be alright by himself as well, even after being left alone. Loves people; but not so much other dogs. Very calm and loving; craves affection. He is perfect for a cuddle when watching tv, which is our favorite activity together besides his twice a day walks. Looking to give him to a wonderful family or couple, preferably in a house where he can run free.

Besides feeding her, playing w her, walking her, bathe her etc etc etc hahaaa Anyways, Snowy Girl is one happy playful puppy. She has a very shaggy fur on top but just like her mom, I think it is due to lack of nutrition coz those irresponsible people didn't feed them with good food. Heck, they only fed them once every alternate days!!!!! Oh, let's get back to the fur part. Her fur is quite shaggy on top and on her sides, it looks like its been trimmed nicely but that is how her fur grows. Very special indeed. She will grow to be medium size but quite leggy coz mama Snowy is quite leggy too. Snowy Girl is great w children and is full of love and smiles.

Boy has a ruddy bark, bright eyes, golden-brown fur and a calm but alert disposition. Another rescuer agrees with me that Boy is an abandoned dog.

While I've never owned a cat, I was won over and decided to take her in. Unfortunately, changes at work means I won't be around to look after her. Heartbroken to see her go but I'd like her to have a good permanent home. Scratch was 2+ months old when I found her. She has had her first vaccination and deworm pill done. She's also potty trained. A month on she is growing fast! Smart, active and playful, her favourite toys are my Ipad charger (forget Appstore, she has more fun trying to chase it around), a stressball (I feel more destressed seeing her play with it then when I actually squeeze it myself) and a little piece of cloth which I used to cover her when she first came in (I guess it is her security blanket). Vet/Owners at the petstore I brought her to were very attracted to her so hoping she will appeal to one of you kind souls. Hoping to find a new owner by Tuesday, 11th June.",6

Dog,24,Mixed Breed,Male,Black,Brown,Medium,Medium,Yes,Yes,Healthy,0,"Rex was an abandoned and we believe abused dog that was rescued by a client from an area close to her workplace. The rescuer had seeked our services in bringing Rex personally to the clinic for treatment and to be boarded. He has been boarded in the clinic since March and is looking for a loving home. Efforts are being made to make this happen for Rex. Rex needs someone who will patiently want to know him for who he is. Rex loves to play fetch and he loves to gnaw on his chew bone. He loves them dental treats too :) A perfect guard dog because this boy is alert at all times, forget tip toeing away because he notices everything! Once he builds his trust in you, you could certainly find a loyal friend in him. His favourite past time is to sit and watch the world go by with you. Honesty is the best policy and these are my thoughts - Boarding is part of the services provided but it isn't the main function. If I'm lucky during my working hours, I could spend up to an hour plus with him but those days are harder to come by. Otherwise its after my working hours / when I'm off / working half day. His walks are only limited to the clinic's back lane and his view of the world is decreasing as months pass by in my opinion. Picture this, put ourselves in his shoes, who likes the same old mundane view and then its back to being caged the rest of the time and the cycle repeats? I get it that the rescuer is financing his stay but one must be realistic. I just don't think its healthy for Rex or any animal per say to be boarded for a long time, and in Rex's case, is he still going to be boarded until the end of the year? Next year? Look into his eyes..tell me you don't see what I see? There is a story there..All he needs is someone who is willing to decode it. His eyes do look sad to me too, its like as though he is crying out and wondering is this what his life is going to be like? Rescuing an animal is one thing but you also have to think about the animal's wellbeing too since he has been here since March! Its not about the money, its about his happiness. Other animals they come and go and Rex? He is just here. Its heartbreaking to see his life at a standstill like this. Just awaiting for someone to adopt him and the wait has extended for months and months. I do feel it a lot since I am the one who has the most contact with him. If I hadn't vigorously started getting the word out about Rex, no one would have really heard about him. The rescuer has never once visited him, nor was there any posters or flyers made on her part to be distributed. The last time she had asked about Rex was ages ago. If human beings could get depression, animals could too. Please introduce yourself by calling / e-mailing / dropping by the clinic if you want to give Rex a chance to be himself again.. Sincerely, Yasmin Kristy's Ark Senior Assistant",13

I had an accident several months ago , my right front leg was badly injured, I had to drag my leg when I walked. Later, it became infectious. The pain was unbearable. Everywhere I went, people despised me. Then I found a place at a parking lot in a big condo where I could hide and rest. A lady who lives there noticed me while on her way to work. She was kind to me. As days passed, I began to trust her. One day I threw myself in front of her car and blocked it. I did not move till she came down and saw my condition. She called for her sons and one of her friends for help but i only trusted her, she put a leash on me and sent me to a nearby clinic. By then my leg was badly damaged , the vet had to amputate my front leg. After one week, i was discharged from the clinic but the lady dose not have any place to keep me so she asked somebody for help. My picture was posted up in facebook and lots of good-hearted people called and offered to foster me till I recover. Now I'm fully recovered and in need of a forever loving home. I am a very sweet girl , cheerful and playful dog. Please give me a chance to have a good life. Thank you.",7

Then, her family left Malaysiaâ€¦ and dropped her in our condo garage. She has been surviving there for approximately 2 years, having 4 litters. Thanks to a lot of patience, we managed to get closer, feeding her and giving her some cuddles. Last week, I finally managed to catch her to get her neutered and vaccinated. She must be around 3 or 4 years old. She is a tokinese mix breed. She has beautiful green eyes, and a black-brown fur. She is litter trained. She would need a family that has experience with cats and a lot of patience. She had to learn to survive the hard way and she is now quite suspicious of humans. But, she has shown a lot of love to us which brought the decision to try to find a family for her, to avoid releasing her. We are going to keep her one more week to give her the time to heal properly. If we found no takers by Sunday, she will be released. We are putting a lot of time and money to save the cats around our condo. To that extend, we are only considering the family who are doing no caging. Having been in the streets, she will not bear to be caged, even for the night. Moreover, we want a family that will keep her indoors at the beginning, the time that she is learning back to be a domestic cat. She will need your love and your patience in order to feel secure again. If you want to give her a new start in life, please contact me before Sunday the 22nd (April).",5

Cat,5,Domestic Medium Hair,Male,Golden,White,Small,Medium,No,No,Healthy,150,"Update on the 18th of October: Parsley has grow up quite a bit during the last few weeks. He had long fur before, but his fur hasn't grown any longer since; so I need to reclassify him as domestic medium hair now, not domestic long hair. He had marbled speckled green eyes, but they have changed to a green/yellow color, and are less specked. Parsley loves playing with other cats; he likes to play on his own as well. He'll find a comfortable place to sleep when he's tired. Parsley has a good appetite and doesn't meow much--only when he's hungry. I've also de-wormed him today. I fostered Parsley from SPCA. He has a cotton soft coat, speckled eyes, and a short tail. He is the boss when eating; he hits the bowl with his paw and stares at other cats who're sharing food with him. All the cats, including my own, stop when he does that (he doesn't bite or scratch though). What is funny is that he always gets beaten up by other cats when playing. He learns fast: When he meows too much and I shush him he goes quite, then he looks like he's meowing, but with very little sound. That's sweet. Parsley is playful. I'm currently feeding Orijen to Pasley; I feed it to all my cats these days. I used to feed my own cats Royal Canin Hair & Skin, but after I realised it wasn't the best quality food I changed to Origen straight away. I was feeding my rescued cats Acana, but switched to Origen when I found that Acana was often out of stock. I also give cats mineral water/filtered water as I don't like to give them tap water; it's got too many chemicals like chlorine etc. The adopter has to agree to bring Parsley back to me to be neutered around mid January next year. I will pay the neutering fee. Neutering/spaying cats can reduce the number of strays. Many cats get killed everyday by accidents, humans, or dogs. Unneutered males can get many females pregnant during the mating season, so please support neutering/spaying to save lives All the adoption fees will go to trapping and neutering/spaying other strays. The cats I catch will either be returned to nature (TNR), or their photos will be put on PetFinder to be re-homed. A cat's average life is years, but some live up to 20 years if they are well looked after. It is a commitment if you want to have a pet cat. Please DO NOT dump them if they are not cute anymore; they have feelings as well, just like we do. Please give me a ring or sms if you are interested. Thank you. Here is a bit of information about cat food: Cats can't tolerate corn and wheat; they cause cats a lot of health problems. The common brands of cat food--such as Friskies, Smartheart, and Whiskers--contain a lot of these ingredients and are awfully bad for cats. Corn and wheat are just used because they are cheap, but they have no benefit for cats. Well known premium brands, like Royal Canin and Science Plan, also contain corn/maize. I'm unhappy with these companies because their products are pricey, but the quality isn't excellent to match! There are a few other brands that are better quality and don't contain corn and wheat, but at a similar price to Royal Canin and Science Plan: Orijen, Acana, Natural Balance, Evo and Feline Caviar(Holistic) all have 0% corn and wheat and are much better quality.",30

She was nearly run down by a vehicles while i had my breakfast and since it is not safe for her to be on the street i decided to foster her while looking for potential adopter. She is very playful and at a stage where she like to chew and bite on stuff so the adopter needs to train her and be patient, all puppiesd are cute but requires a lot of patience and discipline but rest assured once they have matured they will learn to be more docile but the adopter plays a major role in this. A minimum fee of RM is needed for her spaying/neutering operation when she is 6 months old to prevent future pregnancies and diseases such as uterus cancer, so please bear in mind the adoption fee is mainly used for Minnie's operation and welfare. As long as the adopter takes on the responsibility to care for Minnie's welfare throughout, i'll be more than happy so please give her a forever home today!",9

Dog,4,Labrador Retriever,Female,Black,White,Large,Medium,Yes,No,Healthy,200,"Hi! My name is Melody. I am about 4 months old. I was born in the bushes somewhere in Sri Petaling on the 9th September . I was sent to PAWS Mission shelter in early November and was fostered shortly after that by Richard. When Richard took me home, I was quite sick and was quickly taken to the Vet clinic where I was diagnosed with tick fever and put on blood transfusion immediately. I had to stay overnight at the clinic, which terrified me. I remember the vet telling Richard that I was whining a fair bit in my cage. After a few more vet visits and with lots of medication (yuckkhh!!) and supplements, I feel much, much better now. That was 2 months ago. I now have a very healthy appetite and weigh about 6.5 kg. Richard has been feeding me kibbles (with cod liver oil & supplement topping), canned food and rice cooked with liver and chicken(yummy!!). I also get those occasional treats when I'm able to follow some simple instructions like sit and shake hands (Shhh - donâ€™t tell anyone but I am only doing this so that I can get the goodies ). I'm also very energetic now and enjoy running around in the yard and playing fetch the ball/bone/tree branch with Richard. I was vaccinated on 20th December after given a clean bill of health by the vet. As Richard is unable to look after me permanently :(, I am looking to be part of a loving new family :). I am very affectionate, intelligent and loyal â€“ I wonâ€™t try to leave home. Like most puppies though, I occasionally love shoes & slippers, digging dirt to bury my goodies and playfully nip Richardâ€™s hand (he knows Iâ€™m just playing with him). I am still maturing and like human kids need to be shown where my boundaries are. If you like my story and would like to adopt me as part of your family, please call Mrs. Lai at or Richard at .

We at first thought that Picasso is a male (oops ;p we're not good in identifying sex of kittens) and so we gave a male name. But in fact Picasso really looked like a boy when she were young - she was aggressive when playing, always love to disturb the other cats & acts in a boyish way. Picasso was being rescued from roadside several months ago, we saw that there's a man stood there kept trying to kick Picasso away, she was just a tiny baby asking for foods that time! We sent her to vet for medical check up and found that she got real severe virus infection on stomach and she had diarrhea for over 2 weeks even after she took medications. Picasso is a big and healthy girl now and she started to really look like a girl..she's independent, smart, active and always love to play with her toys & friends. She loves to play different kind of toys and will never let you down when you get her a new toy - she will play it smartly in front of you. She do not like to be carried or hugged, but sometimes she will be very manja, she will just sit beside you and ask for your love and a pat on head. Please give a home to Picasso â™¥",8

It's our hope to find a owner who accept him with this disabilities and love him unconditionally so he can live life to the fullest.

There were only 2 remaining when I tried to get them adopted through Petfinder but failed for months as they were highly afraid of humans and fled into an opening whenever I tried to get closer, probably due to the constant abuse, threats and beatings from the restaurant workers. I could always hear them crying out in pain/fear from my home. Sadly I believe her brother was bludgeoned to death. There was nothing I could do until one day during a heavy downpour which flooded her place of refuge, I found her at my doorstep. We have been fostering her and can finally post her up for adoption after 2 weeks of getting her to trust and adapt to humans. She is still cautious and slightly fearful but we managed to give her a bath and continue building her confidence. Hope to find her a good home soon so she can be loved and cared for. She's smart and cheerful too and I'm sure you will enjoy having her as part of your family.

She found me behind her house surrounded by dogs!! She quickly picked me up and brought me inside her house. Sadly auntie Rebecca is busy fostering 5 pups and their mum so she called my new foster mummy Lynette for help. When i arrived at mummy Lyn's house she was amazed by how chubby and healthy i looked!! She says i'm so cute that i make her eyes hurt!! I'm not weaned yet so mummy Lyn still has to feed me kitty milk. I really hate the milk bottle so i have to be syringe fed for now. I hope my teeth grow soon so I can start eating yummy canned kitten food and kibble! Mummy Lyn wants to keep me forever but she can't coz she has soooo many pets now. I hope someone will adopt me and love me like she does. I should be able to go to my new home in about 3 weeks, once i am completely weaned and litter trained. Mummy lyn wants me to be healthy, so my new parents will have to pay for my vaccinations and they must neuter me because there are already too many homeless hungry kittens like me struggling in the streets and suffering.. For adoption to a safe and loving home. INDOOR only. Vaccinations and neutering are COMPULSORY. NO CAGE CONFINEMENT. Adoption procedure: - Set up a meeting with me and Theo. - See if potential adopter and Theo are suitable for each other. I will ask a lot of questions to make sure adopter is suitable. - Succesful adopter will then have to meet us at my vet in order to get Theo vaccinated before being able to take Theo home. Cost of vaccination and neutering to be borne by adopter. - I will make a home visit. - Adopter may have to provide me with occasional updates. Interested parties can call, sms, or email me. Serious enquiries only please. A description of yourself and your experience with cats is greatly appreciated.

I am fostering Lassie and she has been with me for about 2 months. She loves other dogs and will have no trouble going to a family with other dogs. She will chase nervous cats but does not hurt them. Confident cats who stand their ground get their due respect. She is beautiful; I think a cross between Border Collie and Labrador. She learns fast and is eager to please. She is calm indoors but can walk and run for hours if you're the active type. She may knock small children over with her enthusiasm but there isn't an ounce of malice in her and this will subside with age. Moreover she prefers to snuggle up and nap with her people. If you can provide an indoor home, regular walks and exercise, patience to train her and occasional treats AND You are looking for a unique and beautiful family pet who will love you unreservedly, please get in touch at #adoptdontshop #adoptme #adoptionsaveslives #yoycantbuylove #foradoption",2

Dog,4,Mixed Breed,Female,Brown,No Color,Medium,Short,No,No,Healthy,0,"Mandy is a mix breed of Labrador and Shepherd. We have fostered her from a rescuer who found her and her parents abandoned by the original owner. The Puppy is very adorable, friendly and loving. Mandy doesn't bark much unlike other dogs, she would only bark 1 or 2 times and not so loud when she is being played with (Excited). She is in perfect health condition. Very active and has good appetite (both table or dog food). She has been dewormed, no more flees (we managed to remove ticks from her some time ago with her shampoo). The dog is clean and no wound. She is hugable (no strong smell). We love her very much but our time is not enough as she is being left alone when we are sleeping and at work. (No other person to take care and as her companion). We are willing to have her adopted by a family who has always time to be with her. (most dogs are sad when they don't have companion). Preferably: Family Local who lives on landed house (since most condo does not allow pets)(foreigner might leave her alone when they need to go back to their original country). Anyone who can promise to take care and love her as a family member. For those interested please whatsap or email me, mostly sleeping from am till 8:30 pm. Please don't be surprise if I would interview you as I want this lovely puppy to be with the most qualified owner only.",5

When he first settled into our shed, he was emaciated and forlorn looking. From what we know, he, along with his 20 fellow canine friends were enclosed in a compound without food for quite sometime. Quite wary of the human nature at first, Pola has now warmed up to his human caretakers, whenever we are there, heâ€™ll wag his tail rigorously.

Dog,17,Mixed Breed,Male,Black,White,Medium,Short,Yes,Yes,Healthy,0,"Chance was rescued by my housemate from a hit and run near our house a few months ago. Our neighbours and friends chipped in for his treatment, and after a few months in the vet he's now up and about, and staying with us for the time being, until we find him a loving home. My housemates and I love him a lot, but unfortunately we won't be able to keep him as the three of us are not always home, and we aren't sure how long we'll be staying in this house. Chance is still young, the vet said at most 1.5 years. He is full of energy, but reasonably well behaved. A common friend of ours who is a dog-owner showed my housemates and I how to care for him. We take him for walks and/or runs daily - which is great because we get to exercise too! He's great company - generally listens and follows us when we walk, and does not bark at other dogs in houses we pass by. He's tries to make friends with cats and other dogs we meet on walks, but he's not always very lucky. Chance is a wonderful dog. As long as his energy is channeled regularly into positive activity, he will be very well behaved. He has misbehaved before, he chewed up my housemate's slippers and my bicycle pedals - but that's only because we forgot to take him out that day and he was bored out of his wits staying home alone. We haven't taught him any tricks, but he knows that whenever he sits down / calms down, good things may happen (i.e. go for walks, runs, gets more petting etc) - we try our best to encourage good behavior with treats or toys (tennis ball, stick, chewed up slipper etc), and we try our best to curb bad behavior either by ignoring it or staying away, or a pat on the bum with rolled up newspaper. We have about a quarter of a 20kg bag of dog food, treats, a leash, a chain, water and food bowl to give away as well. We just want Chance to find a loving home where he can be happy.",3

We spotted one huge open wound that a fly just went there to settle itself and didnt come out.. It was a late evening, on a saturday, most vet around our area already closed, so we took her to MediVet Hospital in Jalan Tun Razak. Doctor found about 4 maggot wounds on her, one near her left ear, 3 near the tail area. She had to be hospitalized for 4 days, did blood work as well as viral test, which she was negative for. She was anemic and her heart was weakened due to the prolonged infection. She even had to be force-fed with the IV on. Now she is so much more energetic with good appetite! Her suturing was done as well, medication is on for 7 days prior to her discharge on the 19th. Frigga is a very manja girl, who is quite obedient for a stray..she even waited for you to walk first when you walk her. She gets a little anxious when you leave her on her own, but as long as she can roam around the house she does not whine so much. But all in all, she is really a lovable sweet girl..I cant keep her because my father doesnt tolerate dogs. It was fortunate enough after much talk from my mom he agreed to let her stay for 10 days. PLEASE, anyone who would want a manja/loving dog who is playful and sweet, give her a new permanent home. She is friendly with people and even my cats.. :)",4
